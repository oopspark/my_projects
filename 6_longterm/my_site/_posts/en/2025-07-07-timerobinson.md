Sarcasm often contains the speaker’s ignorance about the topic they're speaking about.

Rather, I like straightforward things—just like my own Bear homepage.

There’s no bullshit, just an honest expression of what I actually want to deliver.

The reason Tim Robinson’s comedy skits get me every time is that he always tries to demonstrate how a situation can get awkward when people reveal their absurdity or true desires—things no one would ever think needed to be said out loud.

Here are some skits I like.

Hope you enjoy them too.
