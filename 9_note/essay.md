sarcasm always contain the speakers ignorance on the topic he speaking

rather, I like straight forward things just like my own hear homepage.

there is no bullshits, but just exactly what i actually expirience.

the reason tim robinson's comedy skits gets me everytime is that he always deliever how the situation could be akward when people reveal their aburdity, true desire that no one would have thought it would be neccesary at all.

here is some skits i like.

hope you enjoy too.
